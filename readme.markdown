# Remote Words

Passphrase word lists optimized to reduce clicks of a TV remote when entering a passphrase.

The number of "clicks" a given word requires is its length plus the number of navigation clicks it takes to get from each letter to the next. This second measurement depends greatly on the **layout** of letters that the app presents to you, the user. To that end, this repo has a number of word lists in `lists.`, based on the layout.

## Lists/layouts

### qwerty.txt

```txt
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl
zxcvbnm
```

### alpha-square.txt
```txt
abcdef
ghijkl
mnopqr
stuvwx
yz
```

### alpha-line.txt

Just what it sounds like: 

```txt
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
